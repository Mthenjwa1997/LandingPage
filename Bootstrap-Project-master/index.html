				 	LIVE CLASSES
				 </div>
				<span class="text-muted">Live classes offer several advantages over pre-recorded lectures or independent study, making them an important part of a well-rounded education. Here's why:

					Increased Engagement: Unlike passive learning methods, live classes are interactive. Students can ask questions in real-time, fostering deeper understanding and sparking discussions. This active participation keeps students engaged and motivated.

				 	 PRE-RECORDED VIDEOS
				 </div>
				<span class="text-muted">While live classes offer undeniable benefits, pre-recorded classes also hold significant value in the educational landscape. Here's why pre-recorded classes are important:

					Flexibility and Accessibility: Pre-recorded lectures allow students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly helpful for busy students or those who learn better at specific times of the day. They can revisit confusing sections or rewind for better understanding without disrupting the flow of a live class.

				 	INTERACTIVE EXERCISE
				 </div>
				<span class="text-muted">In today's dynamic learning environment, interactive exercises play a crucial role in boosting student engagement and knowledge retention. Here's why they are so important:

					Active Learning:  Interactive exercises move students beyond passive listening or reading. They actively participate in the learning process, solving problems, analyzing data, or creating something new. This deeper engagement leads to a stronger understanding of the material.
